Install the extension template using yo code
npm install -g yo generator-code
yo code

To test the extension through the extensions menu, it needs to be fully installed.

Blender location
d:\LIB_DATA\STEAM\steamapps\common\Blender\blender.exe

Running Blender with the required script
./blender --python script_server.py

Launching via shortcut
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe" -applaunch 365670

Running in PowerShell
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe" -applaunch 365670
This launch does not keep the program running in the terminal.

The bat file option does not work, the script terminates and does not keep track of the program in the terminal.

When starting with --python, the script starts first, then Blender.
Because of this, there is no context for
bpy.app.handlers
And save_pre, which I previously used when running the script directly in Blender.

Check the full version of the code to see if I missed any details or nuances?
