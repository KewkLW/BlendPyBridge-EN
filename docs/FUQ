A crash in VS Code will also kill the running Blender instance.
Blender runs in the integrated terminal in VS Code.

Double launching Blender will block and notify the user.

Outdated configs might prevent me from finding the Python interpreter in the config folders.

Adding a new project to the current workspace will cause VS Code to detach the Blender terminal from the current session.

No Need :)
You need to work in the development project directory, not in any directory.

Handled:
 - regular script
 - script with register, without __name__ == "__main__"
 - multi-file add-on
